Additional steps are needed to integrate Punctuator:
- Download the model from https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B7BsN5f2F1fZQnFsbzJ3TWxxMms?resourcekey=0-6yhuY9FOeITBBWWNdyG2aw
    - I used the Demo-Europarl-en.pcl
- in the punctuator folder, edit punc.py line 171 to include the file path for the model

- Create venv using 'python3 -m venv venv' from the root directory.
- Activate virtual environment:
    - For Mac/Linux: 'source venv/bin/activate'
    - For Windows: 'venv\Scripts\activate.bat'
- Install dependencies using 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
- Start server by running 'python3 server.py' from the root directory.

To run with Docker:
- Ensure that your Docker settings specify that that container size can be 8 GB.
